## How to run our models 
To run the notebook, the only need is to download the folder containning all our data and available on the link above and to change a few cells of our notebook (keep it if the data are stored on a google drive/delete and change the 3rd and 5th cells according to where the data are stored)

## Methods
We will try to recognise snow from not snow using 4 differents methods, two models based on random forest, one using patches the other using regions and two models using K Nearest Neighbors on the same superpixels than the one with Random Forest
